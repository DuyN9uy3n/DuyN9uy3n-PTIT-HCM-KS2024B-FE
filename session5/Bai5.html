    <h2>5. Groups of selectors</h2>

    <div id="a">
      A comma-separated list of selectors represents the union of all elements
      selected by each of the individual
      <br />
      selectors in the list. (A comma is U+002C.) For example, in CSS when
      several selectors share the same
      <br />
      declarations, they may be grouped into a comma-separated list. White space
      may appear before and/or after the <br />
      comma.
    </div>
    <br /><br />

    <div id="b">
      CSS example:
      <br /><br />

      In this example, we condense three rules with identical declarations into
      one. Thus, <br /><br />

      h1 { font-family: sans-serif } <br />
      h2 { font-family: sans-serif } <br />
      h3 { font-family: sans-serif } <br /><br />

      is equivalent to: <br /><br />

      h1, h2, h3 { font-family: sans-serif }
    </div>
  </body>
